Offline MD5 Calculator.
=======================

The server-less web application for calculating MD5 digest
for the given files.
It uses:

* html5 (FILE API)
* [Cyboze Labs' MD5 library](http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/blog/mitsunari/2007/07/24/js/md5.js)
  to accomplish the job.


[note]
Due to the FILE API limitation, it may not work for large files.
